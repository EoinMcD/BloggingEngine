##Questions

**What is Model View Controller?
A MVC is a design model that is made up of three parts, the model, view and controller.
The model has the data, the view consists of the user interface, and the controller is the middleman between these parts and the input.

**What is component based coding?
This is where you build applications using components, which can be reused and can be updated individually, making it useful for web apps.

**When would I use each one and why?
The view element of the MVC would usually consist of component based coding, allowing the webpage to be updated in sections, rather than loading the whole page again for a small update to one section.

**Compare & contrast different programming styles (procedural, functional, OOP, declarative, event driven)
Procedural languages, such as C, take a top down approach, which means it tells the computer what to do step by step.It consists of procedures, rather than objects.
Object Oriented consists of multiple objects, with most things in the code being called "objects". This allows programmers to keep functions and data specific to one object hidden from the rest of the code, making the code cleaner and safer.
Functional programming does not use objects, and the data can only be manipulated through the use of functions.
